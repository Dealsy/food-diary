When creating files in React or Next JS you should always think about breaking the files down into componets as much as possible. 

The best practice would be if you have something like a large form for example, and you want to break it down into many components, you would first 

create a folder that is relavant to that form, so if its a form for a qoute, would create a folder called qoutes in the components folder and place all relvant components into that folder
