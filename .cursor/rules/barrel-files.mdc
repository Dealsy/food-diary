Unless we are building an NPM package, do not create barrl files, These make it hard to debug and know what's going on

Exaplme on a file that you should not do

// Re-export the refactored quote form
export { default } from "./quotes/quote-form-refactored";
export { default as QuoteForm } from "./quotes/quote-form-refactored";
